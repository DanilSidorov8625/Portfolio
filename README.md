# Danil – Creative Developer Portfolio

A **high-performance, visually striking personal portfolio** showcasing real-world projects, custom UI/UX, and deep full-stack engineering expertise.

---

## 📖 Story of the Build

I wanted more than a generic portfolio. This site is **both a showcase and an engineering artifact**—demonstrating design sensibility, interactivity, and real performance in the browser.

Every detail is custom: **particle animations**, **floating UI**, **custom cursor**, and a **typed intro** designed to leave an impression. It’s not built on a template—it’s hand-crafted HTML/CSS/JS with smart loading and motion effects to give visitors a smooth, memorable experience.

I treat this portfolio like a product—**constantly maintained and improved**, featuring real work (not placeholders), from contract jobs to experiments with GPUs and vector search.

## 🧪 Real-World Context

> This isn’t a portfolio template. It reflects actual freelance/contract/project work, including:
> 
> - Internal warehouse tools used in production  
> - Private app development (React Native, API design, i18n)  
> - PHP modernization work across legacy stacks  
> - Experimental web-based GPU apps under development

---

## 🧩 Challenges & How They Were Solved

- **Custom Particles without Libraries**  
  Built a canvas engine from scratch: handles updates, trails, pulse, and mouse proximity logic.

- **UI FX without Performance Loss**  
  Carefully layered animations: requestAnimationFrame loops, lean DOM mutation, progressive enhancement.

- **Private Project Representation**  
  Designed a way to **showcase contract work** while keeping code private—marked clearly with “Private” tags.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**  
  Ensured complex UI (like floating effects and tilt interactions) degrade gracefully on mobile.
